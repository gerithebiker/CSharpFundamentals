# CSharpFundamentals
I am doing Udemy's "C# Basics for Beginners: Learn C# Fundamentals by Coding" by Mosh Hamedai.

If you are lazy to type everything in, you can use this repo. Not everything is done in the way Mosh showed, because I wanted it to be more "handy", so when it was something like "create this easy 2 liner", then I turned it into a function and called it several times to play with the values. My solutions for the "Exercise"s are not always as simple as Mosh's, but they are working (so far...)
